# GraphCreator
Simple little graph creator app using ShinyR, Tidyverse through R.

To use this app, there needs to be a cleaned data file in either a csv or xlsx format. It's very simple and not all that complex. Appropriate values will need to be used in order for a successful output to be produced. E.g. for a histogram to be created, a continuous variable will have to be used, and a pie chart will need categorical variables.
